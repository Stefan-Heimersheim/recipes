  put it at the bottom of a form and bake it at 160°C for 10 minutes.
### Filling
* Combine the sugar, egg-yellow, sour cream (Schmand) and add them to the milkrice.
* Mix the three egg-white until they are stiff and fold them in.
* Then distribute the filling over the base (after it was in the oven) and
  bake it again for 30-60 minutes (more like 30) at 160°C until the color is golden-brown.
### Topping
Put fruits with glaze on top of the finished cake. Recommended procedure:
* Prepare the glaze according to its instructions and leave it on small heat
* Put some of the fruits in the glaze, wait a bit (longer if the fruits were still frozen)
* Take out the fruits with a spoon with holes / sieve to distribute them on the cake
* Repeat until all te fruits have been used up. You should end up with a good amount of glaze.
