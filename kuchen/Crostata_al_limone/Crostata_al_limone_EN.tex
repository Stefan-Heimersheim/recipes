\textbf{1.}\\
For the dough: Mix the flour with the sugar, the vanilla sugar and
the salt; make a small pile with a hollow on the countertop. Put small
cubes of butter and the egg yolk in the hollow\textbf{.}\\
\textbf{2.}\\
Form a homogeneous dough with your hands -- if too dry use very little
water. Gather the dough as a ball.\\
\textbf{3.}\\
In a cake springform (baking pan, 28 - 30 cm $\varnothing$) spread
the dough and pull up the edge (approx. 2 cm). Put the dough in the
freezer for around 30 min.\\
\textbf{4.}\\
For the topping: Wash 2 lemons with hot water and grate the skin,
use the juice of one of the lemons.\footnote{For a more sour taste use the second lemon's juice as well.}
Whip the eggs with 150 g sugar until foamy, stir the ricotta in slowly.
Mix with the lemon skin and juice.\\
\textbf{5.}\\
Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Spread the ricotta mass equally on the
dough. Bake the crostata in the oven for approx. 45 min until slightly
browned.\\
\textbf{6.}\\
In the mean time wash the other lemons, cut very thin slices and cut
these into quarters. Cook the remaining sugar with 100 ml water and
add the lemon slice quarters. Let them boil for at least 5 min.\\
\textbf{7.}\\
Let the cake and the lemons chill down. Before serving drip off the
lemons and place them on top of the cake. Dredge with the powdered
sugar. Caramelize the surface (with a kitchen torch).
