Ingredients:
* 2 small ripe bananas
* 2 large eggs
* 60 ml olive oil
* 50 g sugar (ideally demerara, I used white)
* 125g flour
* 0.25 teaspoon baking powder
* (I didn't use) a pinch of cinnamon, a pinch of allspice


Bake in oven for 20-25 minutes at 155C fan (I used 175C I think, and it took 25 - 30 mins), check if skewer/fork inserted comes out clean
