# Nussecken (nut corners)
## Zutaten (ingridients)
### Teig (dough)
* 300g Mehr (flour)
* 1 TL Backpulver (small spoon backing powder)
* 130g Butter (butter)
* 1-2 Eier (eggs)
* 1 Pr Salz (tiny amout of salt)
* 100g Zucker (sugar)
* 1 Pkg Vanillezucker (package vanilla sugar)
### Belag (topping)
* Marmelade (Aprikose/Pfirsisch/Erdbeer/...) (fruit jam)
* 200g Butter (butter)
* 200g Zucker (sugar)
* 2 Pkg Vanillezucker (packages vanilla sugar)
* 400g Gemahlene Nüsse (grinded nuts)
* 4-6 EL Wasser (big spoons water)
## Zubereitung (making? preparation?)
### Bottom
* Mix flour and baking powder and put in on a table, make a through in the middle
* Put all the other dough ingridients into the through (so they don't spill all over the table)
* Knead (usually with your hands) the dough until it looks and feels homogeneous
* Roll out the dough on a baking tray (use baking paper or butter to make it not stick to it) - this is the bottom layer
* Put a thin layer of jam (a few tea spoons) on top
### Topping
* Melt the butter in a pot
* Add the other topping ingredients to the pot and keep stirring until it is hot (so that the viscosity decreases)
* Distribute the stuff from the pot homogeneously over the bottom layer
### Finish
* Bake the cake in the oven at 200°C for about 20 minutes (make sure it does not turn too dark on top)
* Cut it into nice triangles while it is warm and let it cool
* Add chocolate coating on the corners if you like chocolate
