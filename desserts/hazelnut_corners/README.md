# Hazelnut Corners (Nussecken)

## Ingredients

### Dough
* 300g flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 130g butter
* 1-2 eggs ([Vegan alternative: 3-6 tbsp water + 2-4 tbsp cornstarch](https://www.springlane.de/magazin/vegan-backen-ohne-ei/))
* 1 pinch of salt
* 100g sugar
* 1 pkg vanilla sugar

### Topping
* Jam (apricot/peach/strawberry/...)
* 200g butter
* 200g sugar
* 2 pkg vanilla sugar
* 400g ground nuts
* 4-6 tbsp water

## Instructions (ca. 40 min)

### Bottom
* Mix flour and baking powder and put it on a table, make a trough in the middle
* Put all the other dough ingredients into the trough (so they don't spill all over the table)
* Knead (e.g. with your hands) the dough until it looks and feels homogeneous
* Roll out the dough on a baking tray (use baking paper or butter to make it not stick to it) - this is the bottom layer
* Put a thin layer of jam (a few tea spoons) on top

### Topping
* Melt the butter in a pot
* Add the other topping ingredients to the pot and keep stirring until it is hot (so that the viscosity decreases)
* Distribute the stuff from the pot homogeneously over the bottom layer

### Finish
* Bake the cake in the oven at 200°C for about 20 minutes (make sure it does not turn too dark on top)
* Cut it into nice polyhedra (e.g. triangles) while it is still warm and let it cool
* Add chocolate coating on the corners if you like chocolate
