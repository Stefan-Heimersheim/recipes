# Hefezopf (Braided Yeast Bread)

*Thanks to Deanna & Christian for making it and pointing me to the recipe! Original source: [chefkoch](https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/378801124204434/Friedas-genialer-Hefezopf.html)*

## Ingredients

* 500g flour
* 250ml milk
* 50g sugar
* 1/2 cube yeast
* 75g butter
* 1 tea spoon salt
* 1 egg
* 1/2 additional egg for coating
* decorating sugar ("Hagelzucker") for decoration

## Instructions

* Make milk slightly warm, add sugar and yeast (not as block, in pieces) & mix a bit. Then add egg and mix more.
* Add fluid to the flour, add butter & salt and knead for about 10 minutes (until the dough is elastic). Then let it grow by a factor of 2 (about 2 hours).
* Then braid it nicely using three dough strings. Coat with mixed egg (important so the Hefezopf doesn't burn) and let rest for another 30 minutes.
* Bake for 30-35 minutes at 160°C (circulating air) or 180°C (top/bottom heating). Should sound a bit hollow when done.
