# Ingridients:
500g flour
250ml milk
50g sugar
1/2 cube yeast
75g butter
1 tea spoon salt
1 egg

1/2 additional egg for coating
decorating sugar ("Hagelzucker") for decoration

# Preparation

* Make milk slightly warm, add sugar and yeast (not as block, in pieces) & mix a bit. Then add egg and mix more.
* Add fluid to the flour, add butter & salt and nead for about 10 minutes (until the dough is elastic). Then let it grow by a factor of 2 (about 2 hours).
* Then braid it nicely using three dough strings. Coat with mixed egg (important so the Hefezopf doesn't burn) and let go for another 30 minutes.
* Bake for 30-35 minutes at 160 C (circulating air) or 180 C (top/bottom heating). Should sound a bit hollow when done.
