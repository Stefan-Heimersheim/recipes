Ca. 16 big cookies:

    65g butter (unsalted)
    65g peanut butter (creamy, and not pure)

    85g brown sugar
    65g white sugar
    2 tea sp. vanilla essence

    1 egg

    192g flour
    1/2 tea sp. baking powder
    70g chocolate chips

Pre-heat the oven to 175 C.

Mix (1) until creamy, add (2) and mix, add (3) and mix, add (4) and fold (mix but slower, "unterheben"). Leave 30% of the chocolate chips for decoration.

Form the dough into 16 balls, put on a tray, press down a bit and add the remaining chocolate chips.

Put in the oven for 11 minutes (will be quite soft when coming out), I covered it with a cloth for 5 minutes and best eat warm.
