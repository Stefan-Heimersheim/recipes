## Icing (Zuckerguss), optional
If you need icing to make decorations stick to the cookies you can
mix icing sugar with a small amount of vegan milk (e.g. oat milk),
roughly 100g icing sugar and 1 table spoon of milk. Adjust proportions
until icing has a good viscosity. Keep in mind that many decorations
contains bee's wax which may be considered not vegan.
