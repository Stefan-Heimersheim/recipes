# English version, "Cherrymisu":

The main difficulty is that this recipe uses sour cherries (morello cherries) that are extremely popular in Germany, but not so popular in the UK. The below assumes you get hold of a [jar sour cheries]([url](https://s7g10.scene7.com/is/image/aldi/202203210242)) but if not you can probably make it work with frozen ones.

Ingredients:
- 200g sponge fingers
- 250g plain (or Greek) yogurt
- 250g mascarpone
- 250g whipping cream
- 1 packet of vanilla sugar (common in Germany, otherwise replace with 1 tsp vanilla extract)
- 1 jar of cherry compote ("Kirschgrütze" in German, see below for recipe)
- (optional) white or dark chocolate for garnish

Method:
1. Whip the cream together with 1 packet of vanilla sugar until it forms stiff peaks.
2. In a separate bowl, mix the yogurt and mascarpone until smooth.
3. Gently fold the whipped cream into the yogurt–mascarpone mixture to make a light, fluffy cream.
4. Assemble the dessert in layers:
   * (Optional) start with a _thin_ layer of cream mixture at the bottom
   * Start with a layer of ladyfingers on the bottom of your dish.
   * Spread a layer of the cream mixture over the ladyfingers.
   * Add another layer of ladyfingers.
   * Add a final layer of cream
   * Finish with a layer of chery compote
5. (Optional) Sprinkle grated or shaved chocolate over the top for decoration.
6. Chill for about 24 hours

Cherry compote made from jar of sour cherries:

Ingredients:
- 1 jar pitted sour cherries (700g, 350g drained)
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp cornflour (corn starch)
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 packet of vanilla sugar (common in Germany, otherwise replace with 1 tsp vanilla extract)

Method:
1. Drain the cherries over a bowl and reserve 250 ml of juice (top up with water if needed).
2. Mix cornflour with 2 tbsp of the cold juice to make a smooth paste.
3. Heat the remaining juice with sugar and lemon juice until just boiling.
4. Whisk in the cornflour slurry, then simmer for 1 minute until thickened while constantly whisking (to avoid it burning). The simmer is important, otherwise a starchy taste will remain---feel free to simmer for an extra minute, just make sure to keep whisking.
5. Take of the heat and stir in the cherries.

You can either
- let the compote cool (and then break it up before spreading on the cream). This may look less pretty, so I recommend covering it with the chocolate garnish :)
- or pour it over while warm (let it cool a little), this makes a smooth finish. In this case I recommend chilling the prepared layered cream for a few hours before doing this.
