## Ingredients

### Milk rice
* 750ml milk
* 150g milk rice
* 1 pinch of salt
* 1 pkg vanilla sugar
* 60g butter

### Base
* 250g flour
* 1 TL baking powder
* 75g sugar
* 1 Pkg v. sugar
* 100g margerine
* 1 egg
* 1 pinch of salt

### Filling (additional to milk rice)
* 120g sugar
* 3 eggs (white and yellow separated)
* 1 Pkg sour cream (Schmand)

### Topping
* A bag of frozen fruits, e.g. forest fruits / berries
* 1/2 liters of cake glaze (pref. the red one)

## Instructions

### Milk rice
* Cook milk rice with all the ingredients in the first group for 30 minutes.
* Then let it cool a bit afterwards.

### Base
* While the milk rice is cooking, knead the base ingredients into a dough,
  put it at the bottom of a form and bake it at 160°C for 10 minutes.

### Filling
* Combine the sugar, egg-yellow, sour cream (Schmand) and add them to the milk rice.
* Mix the three egg-white until they are stiff and fold them in.
* Then distribute the filling over the base (after it was in the oven) and
  bake it again for 30-60 minutes (more like 30) at 160°C until the color is golden-brown.

### Topping
Put fruits with glaze on top of the finished cake. Recommended procedure:
* Prepare the glaze according to its instructions and leave it on small heat
* Put some of the fruits in the glaze, wait a bit (longer if the fruits were still frozen)
* Take out the fruits with a spoon with holes / sieve to distribute them on the cake
* Repeat until all the fruits have been used up. You should end up with a good amount of glaze.
