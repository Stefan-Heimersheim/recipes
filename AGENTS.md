I like to format my recipies in a simple markdown format.
- Each recipe should have its own folder.
- That folder should contain a README.md (all caps) with the recipe.
- The folder may additionally contain pictures of the dish, or other resources.
- The markdown recipe should start with the title (#), a line about the source of the recipe (if available), followed by the ingredients list (## Ingredients). Next should be the method (## Instructions) with subsections (e.g. ### Base and ### Topping) if needed.
- Recipies should be written in English by default, though translations can be provided e.g. as German.md files. The English versions should be the source of truth, and updated first in case of any changes.
